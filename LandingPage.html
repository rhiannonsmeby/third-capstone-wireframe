            Welcome to HappyHabit! Sometimes, managing your mood can get tough.
            You might not know exactly why you're feeling down and you might not 
            have an idea of what you can do to start feeling better.
            There isn't always a simple solution for your crummy feeling but
            HappyHabit is meant to help you find it quicker when there is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, you can track your mood before performing an activity to try to
            make yourself feel better, log the activity, and then log your mood after
            completing your activity. Then, in the future when you're feeling low,
            you can reference your dashboard to see which actions make you feel your
            best.
